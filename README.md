# README.md Generator
The objective of the project is to generate a README.md file by answering some questions on screen. In this way, the developer does not need to invest any time to create a README.md file for his/her new project, just answer some questions and the computer will create it for him/her. The file always have a name of "README.md", because the aim of this project is to free the developer from this work.

## Installation
````````````````````````
The installation of README.md Generator is very straightforward:
- Fork this GitHub project into your account
- Clone the repo to your machine
- Run npm install to get the libraries installed
- Open Git Bash and run node index.js
- voila! 
````````````````````````
## Usage
This README.md Generator is very handy, because it frees you from the task of writing one from code just by yourself. I am already using it to write this very same README file! I bet you will use it for all your projects from now on. 
##Future Additions 
At this time, the Table of Contents (TOC) is generated manually. I recomend you use [Markdown TOC Generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/). It is very easy to use, but the downside is that you need to manually cut, paste and fix your own README to include this TOC. It will be nice to have it created automatically, too.
